## Writing

Explain concepts and changes thoroughly in clear English.

## Development vaults

Use each checkout's generated `.dev-vault/` for runtime checks. It is disposable and excluded from Git. Keep reusable fixture changes in `scripts/dev-vault.mjs`; keep personal books and credentials outside this project. Read `README.md` for build, reload, and runtime verification commands.

## Product direction

Read `docs/product-direction.md` before implementing book retrieval or AI integration. Authentication belongs to the user's unmodified local CLI. The plugin must not collect subscription tokens.
